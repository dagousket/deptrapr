The goal of `{deptrapr}` is to show how managing package dependencies may lead to CI failures.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to plot a dino in smarties color :

```{r example, dpi=300}
library(deptrapr)
data <- fetch_dataset(type = "dino")
p <- plot_dataset(data,
                  type = "ggplot",
                  candy = TRUE,
                  title = "The Candynosaurus Rex")
p
```
